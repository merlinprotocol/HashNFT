# Merlin Protocol
Merlin Protocol is an infrastructure protocol for DeFi mining hash power and its derivatives. This protocol digitizes real-world cryptocurrency hash power assets and then introduce them into the DeFi ecosystem through a hash power oracle and a decentralized settlement system.

We are responsible for bringing the hash power from the real world to the blockchain ecosystem, allowing you to realize whatâ€™s in your mind for hash power.
